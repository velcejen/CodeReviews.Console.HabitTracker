Introduction
        
The purpose of this application is to store and manage information about a given habit. The information stored informs of the date, quantity and location that the habit occurred.
This application uses CRUD functions which are an essential part of practically any app. The main goal of this project is as an introduction to basic CRUD options and also gaining experience with handleing user input. 

Requirements

    • This is an application where you’ll log occurrences of a habit.
    
    • This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
    
    • Users need to be able to input the date of the occurrence of the habit
    
    • The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
    
    • When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
    
    • It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
    
    • The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
    
    • You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
    
    • You can only interact with the database using ADO.NET. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework or Dapper.
    
    • Follow the DRY Principle, and avoid code repetition.
    
    • Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works.
      
Challenges

Bellow is a list of the challenges that I have introduced to the project

    • The use of parametrised queries to make the application more secure
    • Incorporate a seeding function to populate the table. Specially helpful for testing purposes
    • As a personal challenge I’ve incorporated a grid table presentation that permits scrolling through the habits table.
      
New Knowledge Acquired

The most important understanding for me personally during this project has been to start getting the right mindset when using and creating objects and their instantiation. I begin to see the amazing and empowering possibilities that OOP offers.

I will also mention the use of CRUD functions for the first time. I understand perfectly what they do, but I must say that I’ll have to program many many many more applications before I can type from memory any of these functions.
